# General info

The presentation counts for 30% of the final grade

The presentation should be based on one of the suggested paper or paper selected by the students (with my approval)

Presentation should be between 8-10 minutes long and are followed by 3-5 minutes of questions.
They should provide a big picture of the study and the main hypothesis, a quick presentation of the data, detailed explanation of analysis and results, and finally a discussion on the
clarity and adequacy of the statistical analysis.
If the paper is more methodological, the presentation should present a summary version of the paper and discuss what what harder to understand or not understood.
