Provide an understanding of advanced statistical models (including generalized linear mixed models)\n2. Develop good coding practices (using R and Rmarkdown)\n3. Improve data and code management (data manipulation and github)\n4. Present the principles of open science (using OSF, Open Science Framework).\n\n\n# Contents\n\n* Statistics (flexible to be define based on attendance interests)\n    * Mixed models including generalized linear mixed models and multivariate models\n    * Options:\n      * Introduction to Bayesian stats\n      * Path analysis\n      * Spatial analysis\n      * Multivariate analysis\n      * ...\n* Open and reproducible science\n    * R: `Rmarkdown`, `tidyverse` and `workflowr`\n    * git: `github` and other alternatives\n    * Open Science Framework with `OSF`\n\n# Classes\n\n* Duration: 1 class of 3h each week\n* Style: mix of lecture, discussion and practical\n* How: In-person . \n<!--   * Gather: https://gather.town/app/MCa0j7kcdaCNSCvS/AdvStatOpenSci\n  * Zoom: https://uottawa-ca.zoom.us/j/93306840602?pwd=bWNsR3AzQ25VQXJOWCszNmh6RWI1UT09 -->\n* Course info and slides: <https://biostats-uottawa.github.io/bio8940/>\n* Lab manual: <https://biostats-uottawa.github.io/R/en/>\n\n\n[lab_website]: https://juliengamartin.github.io/\n[moi_uo]: https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-science/professors/julien-martin\n[moi_github]: https://github.com/juliengamartin\n\n[cran]: https://cloud.r-project.org/\n[rstudio_d]: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\n[vscode_d]: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download\n\n<!-- extra -->\n[rmark_cs]: https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/rmarkdown.pdf\n[debug_pdf]: practical_extra/tbs_pdf_rmd.html\n[git_cred]: https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/git-credentials.html\n[happy_git]: https://happygitwithr.com/\n\n[git_install]: https://git-scm.com/downloads\n[quarto_install]: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/\n[quarto]: https://quarto.org/\n\n[r_way_en]: https://biostats-uottawa.github.io/R/en/\n[r_way_fr]: https://biostats-uottawa.github.io/R/fr/\n[r_chap_en]: https://biostats-uottawa.github.io/R/en/#chapters-to-read\n[r_chap_fr]: https://biostats-uottawa.github.io/R/fr/#chapitres-a-lire\n[brightspace]: https://uottawa.brightspace.com/d2l/home\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Lecturer {{< fa person-chalkboard >}}\n\n\n\n- Julien Martin \n\n\n\n<!-- ## Teaching assitant-->\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Office hours {{< fa clock >}}\n\nMeetings will be in-person or online using zoom.

Beyond 10 working days the mark is considered final. If the issue concerns a lab assignment, please consult the TA that marked it; if it concerns and exam, please see the course instructor.\n\nWhen a regrading occurs, the new mark will stand whether it is higher or lower, so there is no guarantee your mark will increase. Simple adding mistakes unfortunately happen on occasion given the volume of assignments and exams we have to mark and such cases are easy to correct. However, disputes over partial marks on partially correct answers will not always work out in your favour and should be reserved for situations in which you feel you have a strong case. When requesting a regrading, you must provide an explanation as to what you feel the issue is (i.e. why you think you deserve a higher grade). The more specific this is the better your chance of success.\n\nI do not consider arguments for additional marks simply because you are close to the next letter grade.\n\n\n# Plagiarism\nPlagiarism is the act of passing off someone else’s words or ideas as your own. Plagiarism is a major academic offense (see the University of Ottawa regulation on academic fraud: Academic fraud) and is also illegal. We uphold the law. It is critical that you understand what constitutes plagiarism and how you can avoid it. For more information, consult the following document from the Student Academic Success Service.\n\n# Attendance\nAs per uOttawa policy, to ensure they succeed in all courses of their program of study, students have the responsibility to participate in the various learning and assessment activities for this course. Attendance of the lectures and laboratory are not formally required for this course, although both are STRONGLY recommended. The supplied lecture slides will not include all content presented and discussed in class, and teaching assistants and the professor are available during the labs for help with exercises and assignments. TA and professor office hours are to allow you an opportunity to ask questions related to course material and cannot replace a missed lecture or lab.\n\n# Bilingualism\nPlease note that the class is bilingual. This means that any questions during the class can be asked or answered in either french or english and the prof will translate the answers if needs be. The majority of the course content (slides, lab manual) are provided in english only, but explanation can be provided in either languages.\n\nIn addition, as per uOttawa policy, all students have the right to produce their written work and to answer examination questions in the official language of their choice, regardless of the course’s language of instruction.\n",
